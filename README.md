**Description of pages:**

• The first screen is a login screen.

• Check the Database for the validity of the login

• The second screen is a screen where the user will be asked to input  an url  

• The user will input an URL in a textbox  

• There is a ‘submit’ button  

• The third screen is a display screen  

• This screen  displays the content of the url input by the  user in a new text  
box

• store the URL and response (content on display screen) in a  database (Mapped to the current logged in user id)
